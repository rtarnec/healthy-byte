- Demo of Genkit's ability to orchestrate AI and external APIs in a cloud environment.

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher recommended)
- Firebase CLI installed (`npm install -g firebase-tools`)
- A Google Cloud project with Firebase enabled
- Access to Genkit and Gemini LLM (ensure you have necessary API keys and permissions)

---

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/healthybyte.git
cd healthybyte/functions
```

2. **Install dependencies**

npm install

3. **Initialize Firebase (if not done)**

firebase login
firebase init

Make sure to select Functions and connect to your Firebase project.

4. **Switch to the Blaze plan in the Firebase console**

This enabled the use of Cloud Functions, as the free Spark plan does not support them.

5. **Enable the Secret Manager API in the Google Cloud Console**

Open https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/secretmanager.googleapis.com and click on Enable.

When you deploy the Cloud Function for the first time, youâ€™ll be prompted to enter the secret values (such as your API keys).

6. **Deploy Cloud Functions**

firebase deploy --only functions

7. **Run the front-end**

Serve your static files (e.g. with a simple HTTP server or Firebase Hosting):

firebase deploy --only hosting

or open index.html directly in your browser for testing.
